# React Movies App (Full Stack 2 Assignment)

Please enjoy this fun and easy to use React app which fetches movies from TMDB and displays them in an easy to navigate and explore UI.

Since the labs provided a good base for this web app, I will list the latest features included in this version after the labs were completed.

## New Features

### 1. Add to Must Watch Button
Click the Add to must watch button at the bottom of the movie card and see the orange icon appear on top of the movies you have added to you 

### 2. Must Watch Movies Page
Visit the new **Must Watch Movies** page to see all the movies you've added to your Must Watch list! Each movie you mark as "Must Watch" will appear here automatically.

If you change your mind or have already watched a movie, simply click the delete icon next to that movie on the Must Watch page to remove it from your list. The page updates instantly, so your Must Watch list always stays current.

### 3 Popular Movies Page
Check out the new popular movies page which fetchs the most popular movies from TMDB

### 4. Movie Details Page UI Cleanup
Say goodbye to the clumsy looking old ui on the movie details page. the new cleaned up ui is much tidier and displays the movie images much much nicer than before

### 5. Trending Movies Page
Check out the new trending Movies Page. There is a time window selector componant at the top of the trending movies page which you can choose to see the trending movies for the week or trending movies for the day

### 6. Time Window Selector Component

The new **Time Window Selector** component on the Trending Movies page lets you choose between viewing trending movies for the "day" or the "week". When you select a different time window, the page automatically refreshes the list of trending movies by dynamically updating the API call—no need to reload the page manually! This makes it easy to explore what's trending right now or over the past week with a single click.

### 7. Pagination with Functional Page Arrows

The page arrows at the top of each movie list (which were previously just for show) are now fully functional! You can now use the arrows at both the top and the new, stylish bar at the bottom of each page to navigate forward or backward through up to 20 pages of movies. Click the arrows to instantly load more movies—no page reload needed. Enjoy smooth and easy browsing as you explore a much larger selection of movies!
